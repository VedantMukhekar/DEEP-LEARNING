Time series prediction using RNN â€“ stock market analysis or weather forecasting

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Clearly Explained!!!:
When you don't always have the same amount of data, like when translating different sentences from one language to another, 
or making stock market predictions from different companies, Recurrent Neural Networks come to the rescue. 
In this StatQuest, we'll show you how Recurrent Neural Networks work, 
one step at a time, and then we'll show you their critical flaw that will lead us to understanding Long Short-Term Memory Networks.
