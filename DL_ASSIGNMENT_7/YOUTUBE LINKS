Object detection using YOLO and Pretrained Model:

Object Detection with Pre-trained Ultralytics YOLOv8 Model | Episode 1:
Welcome to the first episode of our new series on Ultralytics YOLOv8! ðŸŽ‰ Join Nicolai Nielsen as he delves into the powerful capabilities of the pre-trained YOLOv8 model for object detection. In this video, Nicolai walks you through the core concepts of object detection, the model architecture, and the training pipeline. Witness YOLOv8 in action as it detects and classifies objects in real-time with impressive accuracy and speed.

Key highlights covered in this episode:
Introduction to object detection and YOLOv8 architecture
Setting up the YOLOv8 model from the GitHub repository
Running inference with pre-trained YOLOv8 models on various sources (images, videos, live webcam)
Understanding the inference speed and accuracy of YOLOv8 compared to other YOLO models
Exploring the unique features and benefits of YOLOv8, including its flexibility and ease of use

Nicolai also demonstrates how to install YOLOv8 on your local machine, run it from the terminal, and use it in Python scripts for both object detection and segmentation tasks. Discover how YOLOv8's pre-trained models, based on the COCO dataset, can deliver accurate predictions with high confidence scores.
